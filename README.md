## Features

- Deep Q-Learning (DQN) implementation
- Prioritized Experience Replay
- Smooth paddle movement with inertia
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Real-time score display
- Training progress tracking

## Current Score
As shown in the screenshot, the AI Trainee has learned to play effectively:
- Player: 40
- AI Trainee: 173

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd pong-rl

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Training

To train the AI:

```bash
python train_pong.py
```

The model will be saved in the `models` directory.
